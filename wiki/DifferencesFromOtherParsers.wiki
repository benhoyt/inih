#summary Differences between inih and other .INI file parsers

= !ConfigParser =

Some differences between inih and Python's [http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html ConfigParser] standard library module:

  * INI name=value pairs given above any section headers are treated as valid items with no section (section name is an empty string). In !ConfigParser having no section is an error.
  * Line continuations are handled with leading whitespace on continued lines (like !ConfigParser).  However, instead of concatenating continued lines together, they are treated as separate values for the same key (unlike !ConfigParser).
